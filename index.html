Life has been kind to her: she’s smart, independent, and beautiful, and has everything life could offer - everything, except a baby for her husband. Boldoo is a near-perfect husband. Husbands like Boldoo are few and far in between in modern Mongolian society - smart, caring, hardworking, and most importantly - crazy in love with Gerelee.
